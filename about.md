Marc Rußwurm received his Bachelor and Master degrees in Geodesy and Geoinformation at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in 2014 and 2018 where he focused on Remote Sensing and Earth Observation. In the final years of his studies, he combined methods of computer vision and natural language processing for analysis of multi-temporal satellite images. His work was published in multiple machine learning and remote sensing conferences and journals and his publication at the Earthvision 2017 workshop at the CVPR conference received the best paper award. In 2018 he continued his research as Ph.D. Candidate at the TUM Chair of Remote Sensing Technology and conducted multiple international research experience at the Polish Space Research center, as a participant at the Frontier Development Lab at ESA Rome and Oxford, and, at the IRISA Obelix Lab in France. He now works as research associate at Environmental Computational Science and Earth Observation Laboratory (ECEO) at EPFL, Switzerland.

Charlotte Pelletier is an assistant professor in computer science at the University of Southern Brittany, Vannes, Frances. She conducts her research in Obelix team at the Institute for Research in IT and Random Systems (IRISA), Vannes, France. Her research focuses on machine learning, in particular time series analysis with applications in remote sensing. From January 2018 to September 2019, she was a research fellow at the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. During her postdoctoral, she proposed and developed accurate and scalable time series classification algorithms. In December 2017, she completed her Ph.D. with the French Space Agency (CNES) and the French Mapping Agency (IGN), at CESBIO laboratory in Toulouse (France). Her Ph.D work aimed at improving the classification of new high resolution satellite image time series, such as the one produced by Sentinel-2 satellites. This work has been awarded best PhD in Science by the Académie des Sciences of Toulouse in 2018. In 2014, she received an electrical engineering degree from ENSEIRB-MATMECA/INP in Bordeaux (France) and a Master degree from Université Bordeaux (France).
