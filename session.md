#### Abstract
In June 2015 and March 2017, the two Sentinel-2 satellites have been successfully put into orbit by the European Space Agency (ESA). All the earth’s surfaces are now seen every five days at a 10 meter spatial resolution in visible and infrared spectral bands. Combined with other sensors (e.g. Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1), this creates an unprecedented quantity of satellite image time series data that describe the Earth’s surface dynamics. These data are crucial for a variety of applications including vegetation modeling, climate forecasting, and precipitation nowcasting. However, only new advanced methods are able to deal with data complexity.
This thematic session focuses on the use of deep learning techniques originated from related fields, like computer vision (e.g., convolutional neural networks) or natural language processing (e.g., recurrent neural networks) that have proven to be useful for satellite image time series analysis.
